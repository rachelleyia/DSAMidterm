# React.js Project

## About React.js
React.js is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, particularly single-page applications. Developed by Facebook, it allows developers to create large web applications that can update and render efficiently in response to data changes.

## Overview of React.js
React.js focuses on building reusable UI components. It operates on the concept of a virtual DOM, which improves performance by minimizing direct interactions with the real DOM. React's component-based architecture and unidirectional data flow make it a powerful tool for creating dynamic and interactive web experiences.

2. *Create a React App:* Use Create React App, a tool that sets up a new React project with a simple command.
